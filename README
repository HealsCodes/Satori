Satori is a XMPP component which allows you
to view your twitter timeline and post status updates,
replies and DMs in a unique multi user chat room emulation.

The driving force behind Satori was the lack of a decent XMPP
bot for micro blogging (mainly twitter).

In the current implementation the following features are available:

    * frustration free server integration as a XMPP component
    * API backend for twitter/identi.ca using Basic- and oAuth
    * display home timeline as a multi-user chatroom
    * display people you follow as chatroom users
    * support for timeline updates
    * support for generic @replies
    * support for @replies to a specific status
    * retweet or favor tweets
    * block users / report them for spamming
    
There are more features planned but not fully available right now:

    * [todo] allow direct messages by starting a private conversation
    * [todo] configuration wizard for service registration / management
    * [todo] integration with other micro blogging services (like tumbler, ...)
